            <p><h2>It played  a significant role in gathering the important data about microscopic organisms by being the backbone of studying biology. It is used by the biologist to further assess the details even the smallest  organism or parasites that cannot be seen by our naked eye. It opened many possibilities and discoveries to science. This is when the discovery of the microorganism and the study of the cell structures and understand the smallest parts of the plants, animals and fungi.</h2></p> 

       <p><h2><span style="color:#44C80B"><u>There are three (3) classification of Parts according to their functions:</u></span></h2></p>
<ul>
    <li><h2><span style="color:#44C80B"><u>Magnifying</u></u></u></span> - Composed of  parts that are used to enlarge the specimen (objects that are being observed/studied)</h2></li>
    <p><h2>The parts of Magnifying are:<br><br>
        1. Eyepiece/Ocular - Further magnifies/ enlarges images produced by the objective lenses<br><br> 
        2. Objectives  </h2></p>
    <li><h2><span style="color:#44C80B"><u>Illuminating</u></u></span> - Composed of parts that are used to provide light</h></li>
     <p><h2>The Parts of Illuminating are:<br><br>
         1. Mirror - It gathers and direct light in order to illuminate the object<br><br>
         2. Condenser - It concentrates light ray on the specimen<br><br>
         3. Iris Diaphragm - It regulates the amount of light that enters the microscope</h2></p>
    <li><h2><span style="color:#44C80B"><u>Mechanical</u></span> - Composed of  parts that are used to support and adjust the parts</h></li>
    <p><h2>The Parts of Mechanical are:<br><br>
        1. Base - Supports the entire/lower microscope<br><br>
        2. Pillar - Supports the other parts<br><br>
        3. Inclination joint - Allows for tilting of the microscope for convenience of the user<br><br>
        4. Arm/Neck - It is held while carrying the microscope<br><br>
        5. Stage - It is where object to be examined is placed<br><br>
        6. Stage clips - It secures the specimen to the stage<br><br>
        7.  Draw tube - It holds the ocular lens<br><br>
        8. Body tube - It assures continuous alignment of the optics<br><br>
        9. Revolving/Rotating nosepiece - It can be rotated to easily change objectives<br><br>
        10.  Dust Shield - It keeps dust from settling on the objectives<br><br>
        11. Coarse Adjustment Knob - It elevated or lower when rotated bringing the object into approximate focus<br><br>
        12. Fine Adjustment Knob - It is for delicate focusing bringing the object into perfect focus<br><br>
        13. Iris Diaphragm Lever - It moves horizontally to open/close the diaphragm<br></h2></p>
