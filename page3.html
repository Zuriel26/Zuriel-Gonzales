        <h2><br>In the modern way of living, it is difficult to prevent the risks of diseases most particularly Covid-19. The lifestyle<br> of many young individuals may negatively affect their health. As I observed many have impaired immune system<br> compared with those with healthy body and lifestyle. These were the people with life balance and well aware about<br> the advantages of having a healthy body. They knew that to prevent from other diseases or Covid-19 they must<br> boost their immune system through eating healthy foods, doing exercises, adequate water intake, good sleeping habits,<br> sanitation, good hygiene and healthy and safe workplace. It is important too that we stay connected to someone we love.<br> Receiving positive attitude and sharing happy memories can help our body and mind at ease and become healthy.The <br>learnings that I got from Covid-19 pandemic are having a healthy body and environment are the most important aspect<br> that we should consider to prevent from the virus or other diseases.<br></h2>
