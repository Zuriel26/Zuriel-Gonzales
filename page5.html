It is almost more than three (3) years when the Covid-19 pandemic began to hit not only in our country but all over the world. It is still fresh in my memory how my friends and I are enjoying to play outside our houses. Upon the announcement of the lock down due to the Covid-19. Immediately, my family members gather advice's from the medical perspective what are the best things to do in preparation. After, it was explained to all of us for safety purposes but I do not completely understand. All I know is that during that time, no cure has been developed yet. I have seen in some news that medical team are using microscope to study and observe the virus in all perspective.  The microscope as medical instrument plays an important role not only during pandemic but most of all in doing researches to the microscopic organisms. It magnify small objects to  further understand the rapid diagnosis of viruses in the patient samples and has contributed significantly to the clarification and function of the virus structure. The use of microscope also helps to guide the public health response of the emerging viral infections. <br> </h2>
