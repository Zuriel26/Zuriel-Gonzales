    <h1><span style="color:#44C80B"><u>Disease Prevention Practices</u></span></h1>
    <p><h1>Here are the top five (5) ways of how our family avoided the Covid-19 or other diseases:</h1></p>
    <table border="1"><tr><td><img src="Pic.4.1.png"></td><td><center><h1><span style="color:#44C80B"> Eat Healthy Foods</span><br>Eating healthy foods can bring a lot of benefits in our body system. It can supports our muscles, strengthens our bones, lowers the risk of heart diseases, it helps our digestive system function, boosts our immunity and above all it gives all the nutrition that our body needs to prevent from the risks brought about by the of Covid-19.</h1></center></td></tr>
        <tr><td><img src="Pic.4.2.png"></td><td><center><h1><span style="color:#44C80B"> Good Sleeping Habits</span><br>
During the time of pandemic our family ensure that we have a complete number of hours sleep.  One of the factor or benefits of it is we were able to think more clearly and can do better in school and at work. We donâ€™t get sick often and enough sleep supports a healthy immune system. One of the most important thing that we consider.</h1></center></td></tr>
        <tr><td><img src="Pic.4.3.png"></td><td><center><h1><span style="color:#44C80B"> Regular Excersice<br></span>Another aspect that our family put into consideration  is to have at least 20-30 minutes daily exercise. By doing this activity combined with eating healthy foods and having enough rest, really feels good. We felt that our body is being taken cared of and we all enjoy our exercises together dancing with our favorite tune.

        <tr><td><img src="Pic.4.4.png"></td><td><center><center><h1><span style="color:#44C80B"> Adequate Water Intake<br></span>Drinking water helps to mitigate the negative effects of sugar that keeps our body healthy and ready to fight the virus. The water in our body washes away the excess toxins in the blood that ensures the flow of nutrients all over our body. We ensure to replace the liquid that were lost in our body after doing the regular exercises.</h1></center></td></tr>
        <tr><td><img src="Pic.4.5.png"></td><td><center><h1><span style="color:#44C80B">  Hygiene and Sanitation Practices<br></span>Most of the time, we ensure that we regularly clean our body and do the sanitation to our surroundings for our own security and peace of mind. Keeping our hands clean is one of the most important ways to prevent the virus from spreading. This is how we promote good hygiene in the family most especially with the younger members. I do have toddler cousins and they always touches anything and not mindful about washing their own hands so we keep an eye for them to be healthy and safe during times like this.</h1></center></td></tr></table>
